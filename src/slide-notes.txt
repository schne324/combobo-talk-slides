Slide 3 - What We Do
------------------------------
Very brief intro to Deque
Key point: we build a11y apps, therefore apps must be Accessible
Also brief: we work on same team (most of the time), and in same office


Slide 4 - Today, we're talking about...
------------------------------------------
Brief overview of topics
Using comobobo as a case study to illustrate our points today
(b/c complex widget, project we both worked on, etc.)


Slide 5 - Framing the Problem
----------------------------------
Screenshot: previous multiselect control in Assure.
Key points:
  - Context: app is for tracking accessibility bugs, part of apps is bug list. Bug list is filterable
  - Hard to find filter you want when select list is big (i.e. >10 options)
  - Hard to know what's selected at a glance (esp. when mult. selections per filter)


Slide 6 - Framing the Problem: Existing Comboboxes
--------------------------------------------------------
Lots of options out there - we looked at a ton.
Problem for us: no options were completely accessible (or even close)
  - Visual a11y not great for most
  - Keyboard a11y: some, not all
  - Screen reader a11y: almost none


Slide 7 - A11y === difficult
-------------------------------
Build on previous slide - lots of finicky things to get right with a11y.
Note: hopefully we're preaching to the choir wrt to collaborating with teammates
Gauge audience - designers? developers? how many devs work directly with designers and vice versa?


Slide 9 - Designer + Developer
---------------------------------
Different kinds of work, same goal.
Designer - concerned with interactions, visuals, info arhictecture, etc.
Developer - concered with well-formed code, data architecture, dependencies, etc.
Brief example:
  - Harris knows a lot about ARIA, Caitlin doesn't (in part b/c she doesn't code)
  - Caitlin's job to choose colors, generally, so she's in charge of good color contrast

Slide 3 - What We Do
------------------------------
Very brief intro to Deque
Key point: we build a11y apps, therefore apps must be Accessible
Also brief: we work on same team (most of the time), and in same office


Slide 4 - Today, we're talking about...
------------------------------------------
Brief overview of topics
Using comobobo as a case study to illustrate our points today
(b/c complex widget, project we both worked on, etc.)


Slide 5 - Framing the Problem
----------------------------------
Screenshot: previous multiselect control in Assure.
Key points:
  - Context: app is for tracking accessibility bugs, part of apps is bug list. Bug list is filterable
  - Hard to find filter you want when select list is big (i.e. >10 options)
  - Hard to know what's selected at a glance (esp. when mult. selections per filter)


Slide 6 - Framing the Problem: Existing Comboboxes
--------------------------------------------------------
Lots of options out there - we looked at a ton.
Problem for us: no options were completely accessible (or even close)
  - Visual a11y not great for most
  - Keyboard a11y: some, not all
  - Screen reader a11y: almost none


Slide 7 - A11y === difficult
-------------------------------
Build on previous slide - lots of finicky things to get right with a11y.
Note: hopefully we're preaching to the choir wrt to collaborating with teammates
Gauge audience - designers? developers? how many devs work directly with designers and vice versa?


Slide 9 - Designer + Developer
---------------------------------
Different kinds of work, same goal.
Designer - concerned with interactions, visuals, info architecture, etc.
Developer - concerned with well-formed code, data architecture, dependencies, etc.
Brief example:
  - Harris knows a lot about ARIA, Caitlin doesn't (in part b/c she doesn't code)
  - Caitlin's job to choose colors, generally, so she's in charge of good color contrast


Slide 10 - who, where, what, when, why
------------------------------------------
Details around:
  - what design review is
  - who attends (or should attend)
  - why it happens
  - when it happens (how often)
  - where it happens


Slide 11 - Design Responsibilities
----------------------------------------
Key point: lots in a11y can be done before devs are even involved


Slide 12 - Development Responsibilities
------------------------------------------
Key point: main dev responsibility is implementation. Designers who don't do development work may not be aware of implications of designs


Slide 13 - Showing selected filters: before
-----------------------------------------------
Overview of how Assure Classic handled this (i.e. it didn't really)
Review of problems:
  - hard to tell when filters active
  - hard to deselect specific filter (have to find in list)


Slide 14 - Showing selected filters: first review
------------------------------------------------------
First solution was to show selected panel as part of widget
Problems: have to expand to see, takes up space.
Big a11y issues pointed out by devs:
  - where does it show in reading order? focus order? How do screen readers get to it?
  - if not focusable, how does it make it easier to deselect?
Too many problems, so scrapped idea


Slide 15 - Showing selected filters: second review
-------------------------------------------------------
Caitlin went back to drawing board and tried a different pattern - active filter pills in different section
Lots of questions came up in design review:
  - Focus order
  - What do pills read to screen readers? (Alt text on icon)
  - What happens to keyboard focus / SR readout when last pill is dismissed?
  - What happens when "clear all" is activated? To focus, etc.
Worked through a lot of these questions in real time as part of design review.
Caitlin took notes of decisions, then added final decisions as wireframe annotations
